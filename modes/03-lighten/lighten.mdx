# Lighten

In the Lighten Blend Mode grouping the Black becomes our neutral point, and it’s not effecting anything in the layer below. Again, if we are “lightening” an image, then you need brighter colors in order to do that. So black is neutral, and anything brighter than black will affect the layer below.
