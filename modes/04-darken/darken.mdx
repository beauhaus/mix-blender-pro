# Darken

All of the Blend Modes in the Darken grouping are going to darken the layer below with varying degrees of contrast/tonality. In the Darken grouping, white is your neutral color. So basically, if the selected layer has white, this will not affect or darken the layers beneath. This makes sense because how would you darken with white after all? Anything though that is a darker tone than pure white on your selected layer will begin to darken the layer below.
